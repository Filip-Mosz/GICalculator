#Welcome to the GICalculator

I'd like to present to you a project for creating website for calculating glycemic index and glycemic load of your meals.

Knowing this is important for people suffering from Diabetes and Insulin resistance.
It's both: worthy of coding due to calculations needed and useful, so no-one if forced to calculate it manually.

I'm starting with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, not deciding yet if I'll be using SQL database of operate without it.
